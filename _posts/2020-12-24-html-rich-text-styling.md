## Examples of Markdown formatting

## Headers

Here's a sneak pick of how headers look like:

# h1 Sample

## h2 Sample

### h3 Sample

#### h4 Sample

##### h5 Sample

###### h6 Sample

### Lists

Now we are going to explore how the lists look like:

1. This is the first item in a **numbered list**
2. And so it is the second item
3. This is the third item.
4. I think with four items is good enough

How about a **bullet list**?

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item

> Now this is a block quote

# How about block formatting?

Code Block:

    .topbar
        align-items: center
        border-bottom: solid .1em $gray
        display: flex
        justify-content: flex-start
        padding: 1em 6.6em
        width: 100%
